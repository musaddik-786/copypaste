1. “Integrate an AI assistant into our CCaaS (e.g. Genesys) to transcribe customer inquiries in real time, fetch relevant plan-coverage details (e.g. knee surgery), and surface them to the agent in a chat-style window.”


2. “Demonstrate AI-powered speech-to-text and document retrieval within the CCaaS interface, enabling agents to answer plan‐coverage questions (like ‘Is knee surgery covered?’) instantly.”


3. “POC of an agentic AI module that listens to customer calls, identifies coverage queries, searches policy documents, and displays coverage details and next-step suggestions to agents in real time.”
