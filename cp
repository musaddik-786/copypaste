This POC demonstrates the capabilities of an Agentic Virtual AI Agent (GenAI) tailored for the insurance industry to handle inbound customer calls specifically related to policy renewalsâ€”with and without changes in coverage. The solution leverages conversational AI to deliver 24/7 multilingual support, automates routine renewal workflows, and integrates with backend systems to minimize human intervention.

Key features include intelligent dialogue management, real-time data retrieval, and personalized customer engagement, enabling operations like First Notice of Loss (FNOL) and coverage updates to be executed efficiently. By combining agentic orchestration with live insights, the AI agent not only reduces operational costs but also enhances service quality and underwriter productivity. This POC validates the feasibility of deploying GenAI to scale customer service operations while preserving human-in-the-loop oversight where needed.
