Step 2. Preparing and Formatting the Regulatory Return 

What Firms Must Do: 

Template Completion & Data Formatting: 

Data must be organized into the prescribed reporting templates covering: 

• Financial Returns: Profit & loss, balance sheet, capital measures, etc. 

• Claims, Persistency, and Product Data: Aggregated claims performance metrics (acceptance rates, average claim amounts), persistency data, and product pricing details. 

• Other Disclosures: Consumer outcome data (complaints and redress information) where relevant to personal lines. 

Verified FCA References: 

SUP 16 – Reporting for Insurers: 

– For example, SUP 16.12 provides guidance on the structure and required disclosures within financial reporting returns. 

ICOBS 8 – Claims Handling: 

– Sections ICOBS 8.1 and ICOBS 8.2 cover claims handling – these are tailored to nonlife (personal lines) insurers. 

PROD 4 – Product Governance: 

– Especially PROD 4.2.25 and PROD 4.2.27, which offer guidance on pricing, product terms, and information disclosure for noninvestment insurance products. 

 Verified FCA Guidance: 

SUP 16 (with, for example, SUP 16.12) for financial returns, and ICOBS 8 and PROD 4 for claims and product-level data.
