Step 1. Internal Data Collection, Validation, and Control Processes  

What Firms Must Do: 

Data Capture & Aggregation: 

Personal lines insurers must ensure that all critical data is captured consistently across areas such as policy administration (premiums, policy counts, distribution channels), claims handling (acceptance/rejection, payouts, complaint details), underwriting, and product information. 

Data Validation & Reconciliation: 

Firms must have internal controls and reconciliation processes in place to verify the accuracy and completeness of the data before submission. 

Record Keeping & Audit Trails: 

Comprehensive systems must maintain audit trails and records showing how the data was gathered, validated, and aggregated.

SYSC 3.2 – Systems and Controls: 

– Specifically, sections SYSC 3.2.2 to 3.2.5 explain organizational structure, delegation, and controls (applicable to all insurers), while SYSC 3.2.20 sets out recordkeeping requirements. 

(These apply to all insurers; in personal lines the focus is on nonlife data such as claims and product details.)
