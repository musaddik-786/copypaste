Claims Performance and Value Measures 

The FCA mandates detailed reporting on claims handling efficiency and outcomes. Insurers must provide granular data on 

Acceptance rates (percentage of claims paid) 

Average payout amounts  

Complaints linked to claims disputes. For example, firms must disclose how claims acceptance rates vary by product line (e.g., motor vs. pet insurance) and sales channel (e.g., direct vs. broker).  

Sales channel differentiation 

This data enables the FCA to identify firms with disproportionately high claim rejection rates or systemic delays, which may indicate unfair customer treatment. Additionally, insurers exceeding £400,000 in premiums or 3,000 policies annually must segment claims data by demographics, such as age or geographic region, to uncover potential biases. Handbook Basis: SUP 16.28 mandates reporting for monitoring compliance with ICOBS 6B pricing rules. 16.pdf 

 

Product Governance and Fair Value Assessments 

Under the FCA’s Product Governance Rules (PROD), insurers must demonstrate that personal lines products deliver fair value to customers. This requires data on  

Pricing strategies 

Cost structures. 

Claims ratios (claims paid vs. premiums collected) 

Profit margins 

For add-on products (e.g., home emergency cover), firms must report sales volumes, claims ratios, and customer feedback to prove these products are not sold exploitatively. 

FCA publishes product oversight and governance thematic review for general insurance and pure protection products - HFW 

 

The FCA’s 2014 market study on add-ons revealed that products with low claims ratios (e.g., 64% average for general insurance) often fail to provide value, necessitating ongoing monitoring. https://www.addleshawgoddard.com/globalassets/insights/financial-services/add-on_briefing_1_104739.pdf 

 

Financial Reporting Under IFRS 17 and UK GAAP 

Insurers must submit financial statements compliant with IFRS 17 or UK GAAP, including detailed breakdowns of insurance contract liabilities, risk adjustment reserves, and revenue recognition timelines. Data from general ledger systems must reconcile with claims reserves and premium allocations to ensure accuracy. For instance, deferred acquisition costs and claims provisioning timelines must be traceable to individual policies to meet auditability standards. 

Key Data Items: 

Profit & loss account (revenue, expenses, underwriting profit/loss) 

Balance sheet data (assets, liabilities, reserves, capital resources) 

Solvency measures and related disclosures 

  

IFRS 17 metrics: Insurance contract liabilities, risk adjustment reserves 

UK GAAP reconciliations (premium allocations, deferred acquisition costs) 

Evidence: Solvency II applies to insurers with €5m+ premiums or €25m+ technical provisions. 

Handbook Basis: SUP 16 Annex 18B requires P&L splits between regulated/non-regulated activities. 

 

Customer Complaints and Remediation 

Root causes (e.g., claims delays, billing errors)  

Resolution outcomes (compensation paid, process changes) 

Evidence: FCA's May 2022 letter emphasizes timely breach reporting under SUP 15. 

Handbook Basis: SUP 16.2 requires quarterly trend analysis to identify systemic issues. 

 

Pricing and Renewal Practices 

Following the FCA’s 2022 ban on “price walking” (loyalty penalties), insurers must submit data proving that renewal quotes for existing customers do not exceed new business prices for the same channel. This includes historical pricing datasets, customer retention rates, and analyses of risk-based vs. behavior-based pricing models. 

Renewal vs. new customer pricing 

Risk-based pricing justifications 

Evidence: 2022 FCA ban on "price walking" requires channel-specific pricing transparency. 

Handbook Basis: ICOBS 6B rules mandate equal pricing for equivalent risks across channels.
