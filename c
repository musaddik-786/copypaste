Applicability

All of these rules and metrics are found in the Insurance: Conduct of Business sourcebook (ICOBS), Supervisory (SUP) chapter 16, and Product Governance (PROD) sections—each of which applies only to personal (non‑life) insurance contracts such as home and motor.

ICOBS applies to non‑investment insurance contracts (including home and motor) 

SUP 16.28 is titled “Home insurance and motor insurance pricing reporting” and covers only personal lines 

PROD 4 governs the manufacture and fair‑value assessment of non‑investment insurance products
