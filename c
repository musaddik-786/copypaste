FCA Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Personal Lines Insurance: Data Requirements and Source Systems
Data Required from Personal Lines Insurance Firms to Meet FCA Requirements
Core Categories of Regulatory Data
To comply with the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) regulatory framework, personal lines insurers must systematically collect, validate, and report data across multiple domains. These requirements span financial, operational, customer-centric, and product governance metrics, reflecting the FCA’s focus on market transparency, consumer protection, and financial stability.

Claims Performance and Value Measures
The FCA mandates detailed reporting on claims handling efficiency and outcomes. Insurers must provide granular data on acceptance rates (percentage of claims paid), average payout amounts, and complaints linked to claims disputes. For example, firms must disclose how claims acceptance rates vary by product line (e.g., motor vs. pet insurance) and sales channel (e.g., direct vs. broker). This data enables the FCA to identify firms with disproportionately high claim rejection rates or systemic delays, which may indicate unfair customer treatment. Additionally, insurers exceeding £400,000 in premiums or 3,000 policies annually must segment claims data by demographics, such as age or geographic region, to uncover potential biases.

Product Governance and Fair Value Assessments
Under the FCA’s Product Governance Rules (PROD), insurers must demonstrate that personal lines products deliver fair value to customers. This requires data on pricing strategies, cost structures, and profit margins, alongside evidence of regular reviews to ensure alignment with customer needs. For add-on products (e.g., home emergency cover), firms must report sales volumes, claims ratios, and customer feedback to prove these products are not sold exploitatively. The FCA’s 2014 market study on add-ons revealed that products with low claims ratios (e.g., 64% average for general insurance) often fail to provide value, necessitating ongoing monitoring.

Financial Reporting Under IFRS 17 and UK GAAP
Insurers must submit financial statements compliant with IFRS 17 or UK GAAP, including detailed breakdowns of insurance contract liabilities, risk adjustment reserves, and revenue recognition timelines. Data from general ledger systems must reconcile with claims reserves and premium allocations to ensure accuracy. For instance, deferred acquisition costs and claims provisioning timelines must be traceable to individual policies to meet auditability standards.

Customer Complaints and Remediation
Complaints data must be categorized by product type, root cause (e.g., claims handling delays, billing errors), and resolution outcomes. The FCA requires quarterly submissions highlighting trends, such as spikes in complaints linked to specific underwriting practices or distribution channels. Firms must also report remediation efforts, including compensation paid and process improvements implemented to address systemic issues.

Pricing and Renewal Practices
Following the FCA’s 2022 ban on “price walking” (loyalty penalties), insurers must submit data proving that renewal quotes for existing customers do not exceed new business prices for the same channel. This includes historical pricing datasets, customer retention rates, and analyses of risk-based vs. behavior-based pricing models.

Typical Personal Lines Insurance Source Systems
Policy Administration Systems (PAS)
Policy administration systems serve as the primary repository for customer and policy data, including coverage details, premium calculations, and renewal dates. These systems generate granular records of policy inception dates, endorsements, and cancellations, which feed into financial reporting and product governance workflows. For example, PAS data helps insurers demonstrate compliance with fair value assessments by linking premium adjustments to risk profile changes rather than customer tenure.

Claims Management Systems (CMS)
Claims management systems capture end-to-end claims lifecycle data, from initial notification to settlement. Key outputs include claims acceptance/rejection reasons, settlement timelines, and dispute resolution logs. Integration with external data sources (e.g., repair cost databases) ensures accurate reserve calculations, while audit trails in CMS platforms help regulators verify compliance with claims handling rules.

General Ledger (GL) and Subledger Systems
General ledger systems consolidate financial data from across the organization, including premium revenue, claims payouts, and operational expenses. Subledgers dedicated to claims reserves and deferred acquisition costs provide the granularity needed for IFRS 17 reporting, enabling insurers to track liability movements over time.

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Platforms
CRM systems store complaints data, customer interaction histories, and feedback surveys. These platforms enable firms to segment complaints by product line (e.g., travel insurance complaints vs. motor) and identify recurring issues, such as misunderstandings about policy exclusions. Integration with PAS ensures that complaint resolutions are linked to specific policies for audit purposes.

Underwriting and Risk Assessment Platforms
Modern underwriting systems leverage telematics, IoT devices, and third-party data (e.g., credit scores) to assess risk. For example, motor insurers use telematics data to refine pricing models based on driving behavior, while home insurers integrate smart home device data to adjust premiums for risk mitigation efforts. These systems must output datasets justifying pricing decisions to comply with FCA rules against non-risk-based discrimination.

Product Governance and Sales Channel Tools
Product governance platforms track sales performance, customer demographics, and add-on product uptake. Insurers use these tools to monitor whether products meet target market needs and to flag underperforming lines (e.g., identity theft insurance with low claims ratios). Sales channel analytics modules help firms report on distribution channel effectiveness, ensuring compliance with requirements to disclose commission structures and conflicts of interest.

Integration Challenges and Solutions
Personal lines insurers often face fragmentation across source systems, particularly when legacy platforms lack APIs for real-time data sharing. For example, siloed claims and underwriting systems can lead to discrepancies in risk exposure calculations. Migrating to cloud-based data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake) enables firms to unify structured and unstructured data streams, applying automated validation rules to ensure consistency across financial, claims, and customer datasets. Data governance frameworks must enforce lineage tracking and auditability to meet FCA standards for transparency.

By aligning source system outputs with regulatory reporting requirements, insurers like AVIVA can streamline compliance while enhancing operational agility. For instance, centralized data lakes allow real-time monitoring of claims performance metrics, enabling proactive adjustments to underwriting criteria or customer communication strategies.
