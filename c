Step 3. Submission of Data via FCA Systems 

What Firms Must Do: 

Submission of Returns: 

Personal lines insurers are required to submit their reports electronically via FCA-designated systems: 

 • RegData: Commonly used for detailed financial and prudential returns.  

• BEEDS (Bank of England Electronic Data Submission): Often used for supervisory returns. 

Format and Validation: 

Returns are typically required in machine-readable formats (for some returns, XBRL is used) and must pass automated validation checks. Once submitted, the system provides an acknowledgement. 

Verified FCA Guidance: 

The FCA’s online guidance for RegData and BEEDS (found via the FCA website) provides detailed instructions on the technical submission process and deadlines. 

Connect: 

Maintaining upto-date standing data via the Connect system is also part of the overall process. 

Current practice mandates electronic submission via RegData/BEEDS per FCA guidance. The file formats are defined by the technical instructions (often XBRL for certain returns) rather than simply XML or CSV.
