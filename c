Step 4. Ongoing Monitoring, Feedback, and Remediation 

What Firms Must Do: 

Supervisory Review: 

After submission, the FCA (and the PRA for prudential returns) reviews the data for accuracy and consistency. 

Follow-Up: 

In cases of discrepancies, the FCA may require corrections or additional information. 

Regular Reporting Cycles: 

Firms are expected to adhere to periodic reporting (annual, quarterly, etc.) as defined in the reporting schedules. 

Verified FCA References: 

SUP 16 and Associated Supervisory Statements: 

– These provide details on the review and follow-up process. For instance, supervisory letters and circulars (which refer back to SUP 16) outline expected timelines for corrections.
