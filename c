RateLimitError: You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.



You have a few ways forward without paying:


---

1. Catch & Gracefully Handle Rate Limits

Wrap your API calls so your bot doesn’t crash, and falls back to local tools:

# main.py (excerpt)
import openai
from openai.error import RateLimitError

def ask_agent(prompt: str) -> str:
    """Try the LLM but on quota error, apologize & fall back."""
    try:
        resp = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[{"role":"user", "content": prompt}],
            max_tokens=150  # limit response length/cost
        )
        return resp.choices[0].message.content.strip()
    except RateLimitError:
        return "I’m sorry, I’ve hit my API limit right now. Let’s try a simple tool instead."

# In your chat loop:
if reply.startswith("I’m sorry, I’ve hit"):
    # you could route to a local calculator or time function here


---

2. Reduce Your Per‑Call Token Usage

Every request costs:

Prompt tokens + Completion tokens.


You can lower costs by:

Setting max_tokens to something small (e.g. 100–150).

Trimming your messages history before sending.

Using gpt-3.5-turbo (cheapest) rather than any heavier model.


Example adjustment:

resp = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role":"user","content":prompt}],
    temperature=0.6,
    max_tokens=100
)

3. Cache Frequently‑Asked Queries

If users ask the same questions often, store (prompt → reply) in your Replit DB:

def ask_agent_with_cache(prompt):
    cached = db_get(f"cache:{prompt}")
    if cached:
        return cached
    reply = ask_agent(prompt)
    db_set(f"cache:{prompt}", reply)
    return reply

This avoids repeat API calls for identical prompts.


---

4. Fallback to Local “Tools” Only

When you hit your quota, you can still handle:

Math (eval-based calculator)

Current time (via Python’s datetime)

Stored facts (from Replit DB)


This way your assistant never completely stops working.


---

5. Wait for Quota Reset or Upgrade

Free trial quotas usually reset monthly.

If you need more immediate API uptime and can’t tolerate downtime, the only option is to add a paid billing card.
