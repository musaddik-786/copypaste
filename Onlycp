Role Agent
Risk Scoring Agent	

Decription
Risk Scoring Agent to generate a risk score for each property submission using structured attributes and underwriting logic, so that  can validate the risk tier and approve/reject coverage accordingly.	



Detailed User Story/Functions
"1.Hazard zoning overlays (FEMA flood, earthquake fault lines)
2.Construction & occupancy classification automation
3.Fire suppression systems audit (e.g., auto-detect presence of sprinklers)
4.Prior loss indicator with source references
5.Historical risk benchmark comparison (vs. similar past submissions)"	

Input (Form Data Ingestion)
Pulls structured data (e.g., geolocation, occupancy, construction type, fire protection).	


Output Data format
"1.Risk Score (0–100)
2.Risk Category (Low, Medium, High)
3.Risk Factors Summary (why this score was assigned)
4.Notifies underwriter when data is missing or assumptions are applied."	


Acceptance criteria
"Uses scoring logic tailored to commercial properties:
1.CAT exposure (e.g., flood, earthquake zones)
2.Property usage (warehouse, retail mall, industrial plant)
3.Construction type (fire resistive, non-combustible)
4.Public protection class (distance to fire hydrants/stations)"








































1. Input (Form Data Ingestion)

Ingest structured data from the Data Extraction Agent (location, occupancy, construction, etc.).

Add: Schema validation to ensure incoming fields conform to expected types/formats.

Add: Duplicate detection (e.g. duplicate submission IDs) to avoid re-processing the same record.



2. Missing-Field Detector

Identify any empty or invalid fields that must be enriched or flagged.



3. Address Standardization & Geocoding

Normalize address fields (USPS standardization or local equivalent).

Geocode to lat/long.

Log the geocoding provider and confidence score.



4. External API Calls (in parallel or orchestrated sequence)

FEMA flood zones (flood hazard).

RMS/CoreLogic CAT zones (catastrophe zones like hurricane, earthquake).

ISO Fire Protection Class (and distance-to-hydrant/station).

Historical claims (internal warehouse).

Weather or climate risk signals (optional if you want near-real-time environmental data).

Sanctions screening (if relevant to underwriting).

Crime index or local risk indicators.


> Tip: Orchestrate these calls to respect rate limits; cache frequent lookups (e.g. same lat/long).




5. Estimated Rebuilding Cost (RCV) Calculation

Feed property inputs (year built, square footage, construction type) into your RCV model.

Record model version and input parameters in the audit log.



6. LLM-Based Context Completion

For any remaining gaps (e.g. ambiguous occupancy types), use a small, fine-tuned LLM prompt to infer or standardize values.

Add: A human-in-the-loop “confidence review” for low-confidence LLM outputs.



7. Risk Signal Flagging

Evaluate enriched data against rule sets (e.g. “Tier 1 hurricane zone,” “historical claim > 3 in last 5 years,” “fire class > 8”).

Append risk flags (boolean or categorical) with rule IDs and descriptions.



8. Merge Enriched Data into Master Record

Combine original + enriched fields.

Normalize field names and units (e.g. metres vs feet, USD vs local currency).



9. Audit Logging & Source Tracking

For every enriched field, capture:

Data source (API name/version, date).

Provider response metadata (confidence score, timestamp).


Persist a “field‐source map” that will appear in both your JSON and CSV outputs.



10. Quality Assurance & Alerts

Compute a “completeness score” or “data quality score” per record.

Trigger alerts or human QC steps if score falls below a threshold.



11. Output to Risk Scoring Agent

Write out the enriched record in both:

enriched_data.json (full detail + audit metadata)

property_risk_enrichment.csv (flattened view with key fields and flags)




12. Monitoring & Retry Logic

Implement retry/back-off for transient API failures.

Collect metrics (success/failure rates, latency) for your enrichment pipelines.

Enrichment Agent	
Description 
As a commercial property underwriter, I want the Enrichment Agent to enhance extracted submission data with external property, hazard, and historical claim data, so that I can make more informed and comprehensive underwriting assessments.	

Detailed User Story 
"1.Address standardization and geocoding (lat/long).
2.API integrations: FEMA flood zones, RMS or CoreLogic CAT zones, ISO Fire Protection Class, Historical claim data warehouse
3.Estimated Rebuilding Cost (RCV) model based on property inputs.
4.Property metadata enrichment (roof type, year built, square footage).
5.Risk signal flags (e.g., “Located in Tier 1 hurricane zone”)."	

Input Data format 
The Enrichment Agent receives input as structured data output from the Data Extraction Agent. This structured data typically represents clean, machine-readable values about the insured property and risk locations, which are ready for enrichment through external or internal data sources.

output Data format 
The Enrichment Agent outputs data in JSON (enriched_data.json) and CSV (property_risk_enrichment.csv) formats. It includes enriched fields like latitude/longitude, flood and earthquake zones, fire protection class, RCV estimate, crime index, and risk signals. Each value is linked to its data source. This structured output is used by the Risk Scoring Agent or underwriting tools for decision-making.	


Acceptance Criteria 
"1.Accepts structured data (location, occupancy, construction, etc.) from the Data Extraction Agent.
2.Enriches data with: Geo-coding and mapping to hazard zones (flood, earthquake, crime), Fire protection info (e.g., distance to hydrant/fire station), Prior claim history from internal systems, Property valuation and rebuild cost estimators
3.Appends enrichment data to submission record. 
4.Logs all enrichment sources used per field for auditability."

AI/ML Models in Commercial & Specialty Property Insurance Pricing

Recent advances in machine learning are transforming how insurers price commercial and specialty property risk.  Modern predictive models – from traditional actuarial methods to cutting-edge neural networks – are being applied to underwriting and claims pricing to improve accuracy and efficiency.  Key requirements in insurance pricing include interpretability (so actuaries and regulators can understand models), premium estimation (predicting expected losses), exposure handling (incorporating policy limits or term), regulatory compliance (transparent decision‐making), and support for complex data (e.g. high-dimensional or geospatial inputs).  Below we compare ten leading AI/ML approaches against 12 pricing‐specific features, based on industry reports and research.

Key Pricing-Specific Features

Interpretability: Transparent models (e.g. GLMs) have clear, global parameters that map inputs to output.  Actuaries favor these for auditability.  More complex models (GBMs, deep nets) often require post-hoc tools (SHAP, LIME) to explain outputs.

Explainability: The ability to provide local explanations for individual predictions.  Insurance regulators increasingly require “explainable” models.  Some modern models (Explainable Boosting Machines, TabNet) are designed to offer intrinsic explanation at both the global and local level.

Premium Estimation: All models are evaluated by their ability to predict expected losses (and thus premiums).  Deep learning models have shown superior loss/premium prediction compared to GLMs in case studies.

Exposure Modeling: Rating models must account for policy exposure (e.g. term or coverage limit).  Traditional GLMs include an “offset” for exposure as a built-in feature.  Most ML algorithms lack a native offset, so actuaries must encode exposure manually (e.g. as a feature or sample weight).

Dynamic Pricing Support: The capability to update or score policies in (near) real time.  Modern ML platforms (DataRobot, H2O) enable rapid retraining on new data, producing quotes “in hours or minutes” instead of days.

Actuarial Integration: How easily a model can incorporate traditional actuarial inputs and workflows.  GLMs and GAMs align directly with actuarial tariffs (ratios and factors).  Some ML tools (DataRobot, H2O Driverless) explicitly support GLM-type inputs and can be embedded in existing pipelines.

High-Dimensional Data: Insurance data can have many variables (risk factors, exposures, telemetry).  Complex models (tree ensembles, deep nets) handle large, high-dimensional datasets more effectively than simple models.  For example, gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost, LightGBM) easily capture non-linear interactions in big data.

Geospatial Input Support: Using location-based or image data (aerial imagery, GIS).  Computer-vision models (CNNs) and some auto-ML platforms can directly leverage imagery or lat/long features.  Traditional models (GLMs, GAMs) require engineered numeric inputs (e.g. coordinates or risk scores) rather than raw images.

Real-Time Pricing Capability: The speed of scoring a new quote.  All listed models can score quickly once trained.  In practice, cloud-hosted platforms (DataRobot, H2O) boast sub-minute inference, enabling instant quotes at scale.

Cloud Scalability: The ease of deploying models in a scalable environment.  Most modern ML frameworks and AutoML services support cloud deployment and distributed training (e.g. H2O Cloud, DataRobot Cloud).  Even traditional models (GLMs, XGBoost) can be containerized and scaled with standard tools.

Regulatory Compliance: (Tied to interpretability/explainability.)  Insurers must demonstrate that pricing models meet regulatory standards for fairness and transparency.  This generally favors simpler or explainable models (GLMs, GAMs, EBM) unless black-box models are supplemented with rigorous explainability.


Model Comparison Table

Model / Feature	Interpretability	Explainability	Premium Estimation	Exposure (Offset)	Dynamic Pricing Support	Actuarial Integration	High-Dimensional Data	Geospatial Input	Real-Time Pricing	Cloud Scalability

GLM (Generalized Linear)	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes
Random Forest	No	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes
XGBoost (GBM)	No	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes
LightGBM (GBM)	No	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes
CatBoost (GBM)	No	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes
TabNet (Deep NN)	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes
EBM (Explainable Boosting)	Yes	Yes	Yes	No	Yes	Yes	No	No	Yes	Yes
Neural Network (MLP)	No	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes	No	Yes	Yes
DataRobot (AutoML)	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes
H2O Driverless AI (AutoML)	No	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes


Notes: “Yes” indicates the model supports or can feasibly provide the feature in pricing contexts (based on literature and vendor claims). For example, GLMs are inherently interpretable and include exposure offsets, whereas XGBoost/LightGBM provide superior predictive power on big data but require explainability tools. AutoML platforms (DataRobot, H2O) bundle many algorithms and offer automatic handling of exposure weights and fast model retraining.

Each feature above has been defined and validated by industry sources.  For instance, interpretability and regulatory demands favor GLMs and novel “glass-box” models, while studies show GBMs and deep nets often outperform GLMs in pure predictive accuracy.  Advanced models like TabNet and Explainable Boosting Machine explicitly balance performance with transparency.  In practice, insurers choose a mix: they may use GLMs or EBM for main rating plans (guaranteeing auditability) and also apply ML models (XGBoost, deep nets) to uncover subtle patterns in large or novel datasets (geospatial, IoT, etc.).

Sources: Industry and academic literature on P&C insurance modeling. These compare actuarial standards (GLMs, GAMs) with modern ML (GBMs, neural nets, AutoML) in pricing tasks for commercial property and specialty lines.
