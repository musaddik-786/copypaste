Criteria	Fabric
Data Storage	" Unified OneLake Architecture  
Microsoft Fabric centralizes data in **OneLake**, a logical data lake that uses Delta Lake format and supports multi-cloud data virtualization via shortcuts. OneLake eliminates data duplication by connecting directly to sources like Amazon S3 and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, allowing data to remain in its original location while being virtually accessible[3]. This architecture is tightly integrated with Microsoft’s ecosystem (e.g., Power BI, Azure Synapse) and simplifies data management through domains and workspaces[3].  
"
Data Integration	"Native Pipelines and Shortcuts  
Fabric provides 150+ connectors and **shortcuts** to virtualize data from external sources (e.g., Databricks, Amazon S3) without duplication[3]. Dataflows and Azure Data Factory handle ETL, while Jupyter notebooks allow custom Python/R transformations[6].  "
	Provides OneLake (a single logical data lake) on ADLS Gen2 that stores any file type. Built-in Data Factory in Fabric has hundreds of connectors (Azure, AWS, on-prem systems, SaaS), plus no-code Dataflows and copy jobs. Fabric natively handles structured tables (in Data Warehouse or lakehouses), semi-structured (JSON/CSV), and unstructured files (images, PDFs, etc.) in OneLake, all accessible to SQL, Spark, and BI tools.
Reporting & Analytics	"Native Power BI and AI Tools  
Fabric natively integrates Power BI, enabling direct querying of OneLake data. Built-in AI tools like **Copilot** automate insights generation, while SynapseML supports predictive analytics[3][6].  "
Ease of Use	Provides a unified portal (Fabric Studio) with point-and-click experiences. Users get Power BI-style workspaces plus Data Factory pipelines and Spark notebooks all in one place. No-code dataflows and the Data Wrangler in notebooks simplify ingestion and cleansing. Since it builds on Azure Synapse and Power BI UX, many users find it intuitive if already in the Microsoft ecosystem. Fabric also exposes REST APIs for automation and supports Git integration for version control. Its large scope (multiple engines and tools) means there is more to learn, but the integrated design (e.g. lakehouses reading directly into pandas via Spark) accelerates development.
AI & Automatio AI	Offers a Data Science workspace with Spark notebooks, low-code ML pipelines, and Azure AI. Users can call Azure Cognitive Services or OpenAI via SynapseML in Fabric. Fabric provides built-in MLflow support for tracking experiments, along with SparkML, Scikit-learn, PyTorch support for training. Its Copilot and data agents help non-experts generate queries and reports with LLM assistance.
Security & Compliance	Azure Active Directory integration, sensitivity labels, and compliance with Microsoft’s global standards[3][6].  
	Fabric is a SaaS on Azure; every operation is logged and can be audited. Fabric uses Azure AD (Entra) identity, network controls (Private Link), and auto-encryption at rest. It offers built-in lineage, DLP, and integrates with Microsoft Purview for data cataloging. Compliance certifications align with Azure’s portfolio (e.g. ISO, SOC, HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, etc.) by leveraging the Microsoft Service Trust Portal.
Scalability	"Integrated Analytics Performance  
Fabric’s performance benefits from shorter data pipelines due to OneLake’s unified storage. However, complex transformations may require tuning, especially when integrating non-Microsoft data sources[3][6]. The platform’s Synapse engine optimizes query execution for Power BI reports, but scalability is inherently tied to Azure’s infrastructure[3].  "
	The lake-centric warehouse uses a distributed engine and supports automatic workload management (no knobs to tune). It also separates storage/compute: you choose a capacity (e.g. F16, F64 CU) and can instantly scale within that capacity. Fabric specifically touts “autonomous workload management” and “near-instantaneous” scaling to meet demands. In practice, Fabric’s performance excels in Azure-centric scenarios (OneLake locality) and is bolstered by global Azure nodes.
Integration with Tools	Offered only on Azure (as a Microsoft SaaS). Deeply integrated with Azure tools (Power BI, Synapse, Purview, Azure ML). Works with Azure storage/services (OneLake, Cosmos DB, Azure SQL) and Microsoft 365 ecosystems (SharePoint, Teams, etc.).
Cost	Capacity-based billing (e.g., $/hour per Fabric unit) with unified costs for storage and compute[3].  
	Fixed-capacity billing – purchase F/P-capacity SKUs and required user licenses. This is similar to Power BI Premium/PBI Embedded pricing. You pay a predictable monthly cost per capacity unit. (Trial capacities and discounts may apply.) Fabric’s model can be more economical for constant usage but may have underutilized fixed costs.

















































Snowflake vs Microsoft Fabric: Detailed Data Platform Comparison

Data Ingestion Flexibility: Both Snowflake and Microsoft Fabric support diverse data types and connectors. Snowflake natively ingests structured and semi-/unstructured data (JSON, Avro, images, etc.) via stages and pipelines. Its Snowpipe service continuously loads files from cloud storage as soon as they arrive, supporting all data types (including semi-structured formats). Snowflake also provides connectors to many sources (databases, SaaS apps, streams, etc.), automatically refreshing data for both initial loads and incremental updates. Fabric similarly offers a rich ingestion framework: Data Factory in Fabric provides many built-in connectors (to SaaS, databases, files, streaming, on-prem, cloud sources). Fabric’s OneLake storage is built on ADLS Gen2 and “can support any type of file, structured or unstructured,” with all tabular data stored in Delta (Parquet) format. In practice, Fabric users can upload CSV, Parquet, JSON, images, PDF, etc., into OneLake and process them via Fabric’s Lakehouse, pipelines or Spark notebooks. In summary, Snowflake excels at high-throughput loading from cloud storage and many connectors, while Fabric provides unified lake storage and a GUI-based pipeline ecosystem. Both handle batch and streaming data (Snowflake via Snowpipe and cloud events; Fabric via event streams, Event Grid, etc.) and support extensive formats and sources.

Snowflake: Supports loading from AWS S3, Azure Blob/ADLS, GCP Storage with Snowpipe (near-real-time micro-batches). All data types (structured and semi-structured) are supported in Snowpipe pipelines. Snowflake also offers broad connectors (Google Analytics, ServiceNow, databases like MySQL/Postgres, Kafka, etc.) for initial and incremental loads.

Fabric: Provides OneLake (a single logical data lake) on ADLS Gen2 that stores any file type. Built-in Data Factory in Fabric has hundreds of connectors (Azure, AWS, on-prem systems, SaaS), plus no-code Dataflows and copy jobs. Fabric natively handles structured tables (in Data Warehouse or lakehouses), semi-structured (JSON/CSV), and unstructured files (images, PDFs, etc.) in OneLake, all accessible to SQL, Spark, and BI tools.


Integration with AI/ML Tools: Both platforms integrate AI/ML extensively. Snowflake offers the Snowflake ML suite and Cortex AI features. Snowflake lets users build and operationalize ML models in-platform: it supports Snowpark (Python/Scala) for training, has a built-in feature store and model registry, and provides ML functions for in-database scoring. Snowflake’s Cortex suite provides LLM-powered capabilities (Document AI, AISQL, Copilot, Cortex Search, etc.) that work over data inside Snowflake. Importantly, all Snowflake AI/ML processing runs “inside Snowflake’s security and governance perimeter,” with data privacy and RBAC controls.

Fabric, as part of the Azure/Power BI ecosystem, embeds AI/ML in its Data Science experiences. Fabric provides Spark-based Notebooks (Python, Scala, R) attached to Lakehouse data, where users can do exploration, transformation, and model training. It integrates Azure Machine Learning and SynapseML, allowing use of Azure Cognitive Services (vision, speech, text analytics, etc.) directly in Spark jobs. Fabric includes automated tools like Data Wrangler for data preparation and has a built-in MLflow integration for experiment tracking and model registry. Fabric also features a Copilot (LLM assistant) across workloads, similar to Snowflake’s Cortex Copilot. In summary, Snowflake provides end-to-end AI/ML via Snowpark, feature store, and integrated AI features, while Fabric offers an end-to-end data science environment (Azure ML/Synapse tools, notebooks, Pipelines) with deep Power BI integration.

Snowflake: Native ML support with Snowpark (Python/SQL), a centralized model registry and feature store. Built-in AI (Cortex) features include vector search (Cortex Search), natural-language SQL (Copilot), and Document AI for unstructured data. Security controls (RBAC) apply to AI/ML features. Integrates with external ML tools too (e.g. SageMaker, Azure ML) via connectors.

Fabric: Offers a Data Science workspace with Spark notebooks, low-code ML pipelines, and Azure AI. Users can call Azure Cognitive Services or OpenAI via SynapseML in Fabric. Fabric provides built-in MLflow support for tracking experiments, along with SparkML, Scikit-learn, PyTorch support for training. Its Copilot and data agents help non-experts generate queries and reports with LLM assistance.


Performance and Scalability: Both platforms are designed for large-scale analytics with elastic compute. Snowflake’s architecture decouples storage from compute: data is stored in a shared cloud repository, while compute is provided by one or more “virtual warehouses” (independent MPP clusters). Each warehouse can scale (up or out) without impacting others, enabling high concurrency via multi-cluster warehouses. Snowflake advertises “automatic scaling” and “instant elasticity” – it can spin up clusters on demand to meet query spikes. Query performance benefits from columnar storage and result caching; multiple clusters can run parallel without contention, and Snowpipe allows near-real-time ingestion.

Microsoft Fabric also separates storage and compute. Its Fabric Data Warehouse (successor to Synapse SQL) is built on a distributed engine over OneLake, with ACID transactions and Delta format. Fabric auto-manages resources (no manual tuning): its “enterprise-grade distributed processing engine” delivers “industry-leading performance at scale”. Fabric warehouses can scale up instantaneously (storage and compute are separated) and support many concurrent users and queries. In practice, Microsoft claims Fabric scales out on demand and benefits from Azure’s global infrastructure. For example, both systems handle petabyte-scale data and hundreds of concurrent queries, but Snowflake’s proven multi-cluster approach provides isolated scaling, while Fabric’s tight integration (OneLake + Synapse engine) aims for fast cross-database queries without data duplication.

Snowflake: Multi-cluster virtual warehouses isolate workloads, so heavy queries do not slow down others. Storage is shared, but compute can auto-scale (up to thousands of servers if needed). Benchmarks show Snowflake easily handles high concurrency and complex queries by provisioning additional clusters. Its serverless Snowpipe and Auto Scaling mean new data and workloads can be added with minimal lag.

Fabric: The lake-centric warehouse uses a distributed engine and supports automatic workload management (no knobs to tune). It also separates storage/compute: you choose a capacity (e.g. F16, F64 CU) and can instantly scale within that capacity. Fabric specifically touts “autonomous workload management” and “near-instantaneous” scaling to meet demands. In practice, Fabric’s performance excels in Azure-centric scenarios (OneLake locality) and is bolstered by global Azure nodes.


Security, Compliance, and Governance: Both platforms provide enterprise-grade security and governance. Snowflake enforces encryption at rest and in transit, with fine-grained access controls. Its access control is based on a combination of Discretionary, Role-Based (RBAC) and User-Based controls. In practice, privileges are granted to roles, which are then assigned to users (RBAC); this model (plus ownership/delegation) allows detailed permission management. Snowflake also offers dynamic data masking, external tokenization, and integration with OKTA/Azure AD for user auth. It maintains audit logs (Access History) and supports data lineage (via metadata). Snowflake meets major compliance standards: it provides SOC 1/2 Type II, PCI DSS Level 1, HIPAA/HITRUST, ISO 27001/27017/27018, FedRAMP, and many region-specific certifications (including EU and Asia). For example, Snowflake is GxP-compliant (suitable for regulated pharma data) and participates in the HITRUST framework for healthcare data. Its customer data never trains its shared AI models, and all AI features run inside Snowflake’s security perimeter.

Fabric inherits Azure’s security stack. All Fabric workloads run in Microsoft’s cloud and leverage Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) for authentication. Fabric data is encrypted by default at rest and in transit, and administrators can enforce network isolation (Private Link) or Conditional Access policies. It supports multi-geo deployments for data sovereignty. Built-in governance includes integration with Microsoft Purview: every Fabric item can have data lineage tracking and sensitivity labels, and Purview catalogs and DLP policies can apply across the Fabric data estate. Fabric supports industry standards and regulatory compliance just like other Azure services (SOC, ISO, FedRAMP, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.). In summary, both platforms have robust security. Snowflake adds proprietary features like dynamic masking and horizon cataloging, while Fabric leverages Azure’s controls (Entra RBAC, Purview governance, Key Vault encryption). Both provide audit trails and role-based access. Fabric explicitly states it is “always on” encrypted, “compliant” with global standards, and “governable” via lineage and labels, matching Snowflake’s emphasis on compliance and governance.

Snowflake: Strong RBAC (roles/privileges) plus ownership/secondary roles. All data encrypted end-to-end. Meets SOC1/2, PCI, HIPAA/HITRUST, ISO, FedRAMP, etc. Snowflake is GxP-compatible for life sciences. It provides audit histories and (in its Horizon catalog) supports data lineage and data quality governance.

Fabric: Fabric is a SaaS on Azure; every operation is logged and can be audited. Fabric uses Azure AD (Entra) identity, network controls (Private Link), and auto-encryption at rest. It offers built-in lineage, DLP, and integrates with Microsoft Purview for data cataloging. Compliance certifications align with Azure’s portfolio (e.g. ISO, SOC, HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, etc.) by leveraging the Microsoft Service Trust Portal.


Cost and Pricing Model: Snowflake and Fabric use different pricing approaches. Snowflake primarily uses a pay-as-you-go model: you are billed for compute (“credits” per second/minute of warehouse time) and separately for data storage and egress. This can be cost-effective for variable workloads, but large or sustained usage can accumulate cost. (Snowflake also offers capacity plans for reserved pricing.) A known drawback is that “charges for both storage and compute can lead to higher expenses” if not managed carefully. Fabric, by contrast, uses a capacity-based licensing model. An organization purchases a Fabric capacity (e.g. F8, F64, etc.) which includes a fixed number of Capacity Units (CUs). Capacity SKUs (F2, F4, F8…F2048) each provide a fixed compute resource pool. A per-user seat license (Free, Pro, or Premium) is required on top of capacity. In effect, Fabric billing is more like Azure services: you pay a flat monthly fee for each capacity SKU and for any Premium Per-User licenses. (There are also free trials and monthly quotas.) The Fabric model can be simpler to budget for steady workloads, whereas Snowflake’s model can be more granular and variable. For example, Snowflake emphasizes “usage-based pricing” for flexibility, while Fabric’s capacity SKUs encourage right-sizing (you choose F8, F64, etc. according to needs).

Snowflake: Usage-based billing – pay per-second for warehouses plus storage/egress. Offers discounts for pre-purchasing capacity. Known drawback: costs can rise quickly with heavy usage. Good for unpredictable or bursty workloads.

Fabric: Fixed-capacity billing – purchase F/P-capacity SKUs and required user licenses. This is similar to Power BI Premium/PBI Embedded pricing. You pay a predictable monthly cost per capacity unit. (Trial capacities and discounts may apply.) Fabric’s model can be more economical for constant usage but may have underutilized fixed costs.


Ecosystem Compatibility: Snowflake is cloud-agnostic, running on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. It natively supports loading from all three cloud’s storage (Amazon S3, Azure Blob/ADLS, Google Cloud Storage) and generally integrates with services on any of those clouds. By contrast, Microsoft Fabric is a Microsoft Azure-based SaaS. It “runs in the Microsoft cloud” and is tightly integrated with Azure and Power BI services. Fabric works best in an Azure-centric environment: OneLake can be accessed by Azure services (Synapse, Databricks, etc.), and Fabric items can be managed via Azure Resource Manager or the Fabric portal. It does not natively run on AWS/GCP. In summary: Snowflake allows multi-cloud deployment (user chooses any major provider) and is common in multi-cloud strategies. Fabric, being an Azure service, is effectively single-cloud (Azure) and excels in hybrid/Microsoft 365/Azure stacks. Both have rich integrations: Snowflake with third-party BI/ETL tools and marketplaces, and Fabric with Power BI, Office 365, Azure Synapse/Purview, etc.

Snowflake: Runs on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud interchangeably, enabling cloud-agnostic or multi-cloud architectures. Integrates with services across clouds (e.g. can deploy in AWS but query data in Azure).

Fabric: Offered only on Azure (as a Microsoft SaaS). Deeply integrated with Azure tools (Power BI, Synapse, Purview, Azure ML). Works with Azure storage/services (OneLake, Cosmos DB, Azure SQL) and Microsoft 365 ecosystems (SharePoint, Teams, etc.).


Ease of Use & Developer Experience: Snowflake and Fabric both strive for user-friendly experiences, but in different ways. Snowflake offers a clean SQL-based interface: developers use the Snowflake web console (Worksheets), SnowSQL CLI, or connectors (ODBC/JDBC/Python/Spark). Its UI is intuitive for data analysts (SQL queries, visual explain plans, data sharing). Snowflake also has a rich ecosystem of tools (Snowsight analytics UI, Notebooks in preview, Streamlit support, etc.). Documentation is extensive. Because Snowflake focuses on SQL, many users find the learning curve moderate (the SQL dialect is standard) but must learn some cloud concepts. As noted, some find Snowflake’s architecture novel, requiring tuning (warehouses, clustering keys).

Fabric’s experience is unified via the Fabric portal (a new web UI similar to Power BI Service). It provides low-code/no-code tooling: drag-and-drop dataflows, Power Query, pipelines designer, etc. Developers can use Spark notebooks (with built-in data wrangling tools) or SQL queries (via lakehouses or SQL warehouses) without needing separate tools. Fabric embeds Copilot and templates to help beginners. For BI users, Fabric converges Power BI (as a workload) so report building is seamless. In essence, Fabric can be easier for teams familiar with Microsoft data tools – it “converges the world of data lakes and warehouses into a simple SaaS experience”. Snowflake is generally simpler if you only need SQL warehousing; Fabric has more components (Synapse notebooks, Power BI, Data Factory) which can be powerful but may have a learning curve. Both platforms provide SDKs and APIs: Snowflake has Snowflake Connector for Python/Go/Spark, and Fabric has REST APIs and Azure SDK integration.

Snowflake: Web UI (Snowsight), SnowSQL CLI, JDBC/ODBC drivers, and native language connectors (Python, Spark) allow developers to work in familiar environments. The SQL experience is straightforward and well-documented. It integrates easily with BI/ETL tools (Tableau, Alteryx, etc.). However, teams must understand concepts like virtual warehouses and credits, which may require training.

Fabric: Provides a unified portal (Fabric Studio) with point-and-click experiences. Users get Power BI-style workspaces plus Data Factory pipelines and Spark notebooks all in one place. No-code dataflows and the Data Wrangler in notebooks simplify ingestion and cleansing. Since it builds on Azure Synapse and Power BI UX, many users find it intuitive if already in the Microsoft ecosystem. Fabric also exposes REST APIs for automation and supports Git integration for version control. Its large scope (multiple engines and tools) means there is more to learn, but the integrated design (e.g. lakehouses reading directly into pandas via Spark) accelerates development.


Sources: Official documentation and industry analyses were consulted for all points. For Snowflake, see the Snowflake docs on Snowpipe, access control, and AI/ML features. For Fabric, Microsoft’s docs outline Data Factory connectors, OneLake storage, Fabric data warehouse design, security, and data science capabilities. Analyst and vendor reports provide contextual comparisons. All statements above are supported by cited sources for verification.

## Architecture and Data Storage  

### Snowflake: Decoupled Storage and Compute  
Snowflake’s architecture separates storage, compute, and system services, enabling independent scaling of resources. Storage is handled via cloud-agnostic object storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob), while compute resources are managed through virtual warehouses that can be dynamically resized or paused[1]. Data is automatically partitioned into **micro-partitions** (50–500 MB uncompressed), which store metadata such as value ranges and distinct counts for efficient query pruning[2]. This design ensures that compute resources are allocated based on workload demands, avoiding underutilization during non-peak periods[1][2].  

### Microsoft Fabric: Unified OneLake Architecture  
Microsoft Fabric centralizes data in **OneLake**, a logical data lake that uses Delta Lake format and supports multi-cloud data virtualization via shortcuts. OneLake eliminates data duplication by connecting directly to sources like Amazon S3 and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, allowing data to remain in its original location while being virtually accessible[3]. This architecture is tightly integrated with Microsoft’s ecosystem (e.g., Power BI, Azure Synapse) and simplifies data management through domains and workspaces[3].  

**Key Comparison**  
- **Scalability**: Snowflake’s decoupled model supports elastic scaling for storage and compute[1][4], while Fabric’s OneLake relies on Azure’s scalability[3].  
- **Multi-Cloud Flexibility**: Snowflake operates across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud[1], whereas Fabric prioritizes Azure but supports limited multi-cloud ingestion[3].  

---

## Performance and Scalability  

### Snowflake: Concurrent Workload Handling  
Snowflake’s virtual warehouses enable automatic concurrency scaling, allowing thousands of queries to run simultaneously without resource contention. Micro-partitioning and metadata-driven pruning reduce I/O overhead, while auto-scaling adjusts compute resources based on demand[1][4]. For example, a virtual warehouse can scale from X-Small (1 cluster) to 4X-Large (16 clusters) to handle peak reporting workloads[4].  

### Microsoft Fabric: Integrated Analytics Performance  
Fabric’s performance benefits from shorter data pipelines due to OneLake’s unified storage. However, complex transformations may require tuning, especially when integrating non-Microsoft data sources[3][6]. The platform’s Synapse engine optimizes query execution for Power BI reports, but scalability is inherently tied to Azure’s infrastructure[3].  

**Evidence-Based Insights**  
- Snowflake’s separation of storage and compute ensures consistent performance for concurrent users[1][4].  
- Fabric’s performance is optimal for Azure-centric workflows but may lag in hybrid environments[3][6].  

---

## Data Integration and Ingestion  

### Snowflake: Snowpipe and Third-Party ETL  
Snowflake supports continuous data ingestion via **Snowpipe**, which loads micro-batches of data from stages (e.g., S3 buckets) within minutes[5]. It integrates with ETL tools like Fivetran and Matillion, enabling automated pipelines for structured and semi-structured data[5].  

### Microsoft Fabric: Native Pipelines and Shortcuts  
Fabric provides 150+ connectors and **shortcuts** to virtualize data from external sources (e.g., Databricks, Amazon S3) without duplication[3]. Dataflows and Azure Data Factory handle ETL, while Jupyter notebooks allow custom Python/R transformations[6].  

**Use Case Implications**  
- Snowflake’s Snowpipe is ideal for real-time data ingestion from Hercules’s uploads[5].  
- Fabric’s shortcuts reduce data movement overhead if Hercules uses Azure or AWS[3][6].  

---

## Analytics and Reporting Capabilities  

### Snowflake: Third-Party BI and Notebooks  
Snowflake relies on integrations with tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Looker for visualization[7]. Data sharing via **Snowflake Data Share** allows secure access to curated datasets for custom analytics[7].  

### Microsoft Fabric: Native Power BI and AI Tools  
Fabric natively integrates Power BI, enabling direct querying of OneLake data. Built-in AI tools like **Copilot** automate insights generation, while SynapseML supports predictive analytics[3][6].  

**Reporting Efficiency**  
- Fabric’s tight Power BI integration accelerates dashboard creation[3][6].  
- Snowflake requires additional setup for AI-driven reporting[7].  

---

## Security and Compliance  

Both platforms offer robust security:  
- **Snowflake**: Role-based access control (RBAC), virtual private instances, and compliance with SOC 2, HIPAA, and GDPR[1][7].  
- **Microsoft Fabric**: Azure Active Directory integration, sensitivity labels, and compliance with Microsoft’s global standards[3][6].  

**Critical Differentiator**  
- Snowflake’s data sharing does not transfer storage costs, whereas Fabric’s security is optimized for Azure users[3][7].  

---

## Cost Considerations  

- **Snowflake**: Pay-as-you-go pricing for storage and compute, with reserved instances for predictable workloads[1][5].  
- **Microsoft Fabric**: Capacity-based billing (e.g., $/hour per Fabric unit) with unified costs for storage and compute[3].  

**Cost Scenarios**  
- Variable workloads (e.g., monthly reporting peaks) favor Snowflake’s elasticity[1][4].  
- Steady Azure-based workloads align with Fabric’s predictable pricing[3].  

---

## Conclusion  

For Jain’s mutual fund and private equity reporting solution:  
1. **Choose Snowflake** if Hercules uses multi-cloud storage, requires high concurrency, or prioritizes third-party BI tools[1][5][7].  
2. **Choose Microsoft Fabric** if the organization relies on Azure, seeks native Power BI/AI integration, or aims to minimize data duplication[3][6].  

Both platforms meet security and scalability needs, but the decision hinges on existing infrastructure and reporting complexity.
