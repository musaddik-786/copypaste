How to Use These Categories in Your Deck

1. Slide per Category: Show which fields auto-populate and highlight what still needs manual input.


2. Color-code by Source: e.g. blue = database, red = image-CV, gray = manual at FNOL.


3. Call-outs: Annotate one or two example questions under each category to make it concrete.



This structure not only groups 60+ questions into 8 cohesive buckets, but also clearly maps each bucket to your data-source (DB vs. CV) so your audience instantly sees where the automation value lies.

Challenges of FNOL (First Notice of Loss) Process
01 Lengthy and Complex Claim Initiation

Tedious and time-consuming process for customers to answer extensive questionnaires after a vehicle incident

High risk of incomplete or inaccurate information being submitted, leading to delays in claim initiation

02 Manual and Subjective Damage Assessment

Reliance on physical inspections or manual photo reviews by adjusters

Inconsistencies and delays in damage evaluation, often resulting in prolonged claim cycles

03 Missed or Underreported Damages

Customers may unintentionally omit certain damages during initial reporting

Leads to multiple follow-ups, re-inspections, and increased operational workload

04 Scalability Challenges During Peak Events

Difficulty in handling surges in FNOL submissions during catastrophic events or high-accident periods

Limited ability to rapidly scale assessment resources, resulting in backlogs and customer dissatisfaction

05 Limited Customer Engagement and Feedback Mechanism

Lack of real-time feedback channels for customers to report missed or newly discovered damages

Missed opportunities to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of damage assessment processes

06 Integration Gaps with Core Claims Systems

Fragmented data flow between FNOL intake, damage assessment, and downstream claims processing

Increased risk of errors, rework, and inefficiencies due to poor system integration

07 Dependency on Customer’s Digital Skills and Device Quality

Challenges for customers who are less tech-savvy or lack access to high-quality smartphones

Potential for poor-quality images or incomplete submissions affecting claim accuracy

















Certainly! Based on our previous discussions regarding the AI-powered First Notice of Loss (FNOL) Proof of Concept (POC) for motor vehicle claims, here's a structured outline of the challenges and corresponding AI-driven solutions:


---

Solution: Utilize AI to automate the extraction and validation of information from FNOL reports, integrating seamlessly with existing workflows to expedite claim processing and reduce manual intervention.  


---

04 Continuous Learning & Model Enhancement

Challenge: Static AI models may become outdated, reducing accuracy over time. 

Solution: Incorporate machine learning techniques that allow models to learn from new data and feedback continuously, improving accuracy in damage assessment and claim processing over time.  


---

05 Enhanced Fraud Detection & Risk Management

Challenge: Detecting fraudulent claims manually is challenging and resource-intensive. 

Solution: Implement AI algorithms that analyze patterns and anomalies in claims data to identify potential fraud, enabling proactive risk management.  


---

06 Comprehensive Reporting & Analytics

Challenge: Lack of real-time insights into claims data hampers decision-making and operational efficiency. 

Solution: Leverage AI to analyze large datasets, providing actionable insights into claim trends, operational performance, and customer satisfaction metrics, facilitating informed decision-making.  


---

07 Seamless Integration with Existing Systems

Challenge: Integrating new AI solutions with legacy systems can be complex and disruptive. 

Solution: Design AI solutions with compatibility in mind, ensuring they can integrate smoothly with existing insurance platforms through intelligent APIs, minimizing disruption and maximizing efficiency.

If you require further elaboration on any of these components or assistance in developing detailed content for each, feel free to ask!




























“Create a responsive web dashboard for managing vehicle damage claims. Do not replicate any existing design, but include all these features in a fresh layout:

1. Global Header

Left: Logo placeholder + page title “Genius CLAIM”

Center: Vehicle summary line: 2016 BMW X3 xDrive28i (make, model, year) with VIN underneath

Right: User avatar icon, notification bell icon


2. Sidebar (left) – vertical navigation

Items: Summary, Front Left, Front Right, Rear Left, Rear Right

Highlight the active section (“Front Left”) with a bold accent color


3. Main Content Area (two columns)

Column A (damage map)

Large photo placeholder of the vehicle

Overlaid, semi-transparent colored shapes marking damaged zones (use teal for ‘inspect’, amber for ‘review’, gray for ‘ok’)

Label the current view (“Front Left”) at the top of the image

Timestamp or image ID in small text below


Column B (parts & actions)

Tabs at top: External Parts | Internal Parts

In each tab, list each part as a collapsible accordion item showing:

1. Part name (e.g. “Front Bumper”)


2. Price (e.g. “$1,273.33”)


3. Action selector: a dropdown with options “Replace,” “Repair,” or “None”


4. Review checkbox or toggle



At the bottom of the list, show totals: “Repair Cost: $6,395.06” and “ACV: $17,525”



4. Status indicators (top-right of main area)

Two circular icon badges with micro-text below:

Damage severity (use an icon + “Moderate”)

AI confidence (use a checkmark + “92%”)



5. Styling & tone

Clean, minimalist, plenty of white space

Accent colors: teal (#1FAAAA), amber (#F0A500), slate gray (#6B7280)

Rounded corners on cards, subtle drop-shadows

Sans-serif font (e.g. Inter or Roboto)


6. Responsive behavior

Collapse the sidebar into a top hamburger menu on narrow viewports

Parts accordions stretch full-width on mobile


“Use this spec to generate a new web page design—same functionality, different structure and styling.”


















Challenges of Insurance Contact Center

01 Surges of Claims enquiry calls during high demand periods like CAT events

Challenges of scalability and flexibility 
Difficult to handle High Volume of Customer Inquiries during CAT events

02 Policy enquiries to understand Policy Term, Coverage limits, Exclusions and Premium impact on change

Difficulty in making policy changes or 
Understanding the impact on premium for any change in Policy

03 Agent Burnout and Attrition & knowledge loss due to Attrition

Complex domain so requires significant investment in training
So, attrition increases recruitment & training Cost
service quality drop after attrition

04 Billing and Payments related enquiries 

Confusion regarding billing cycles, payment schedules, or discrepancies in charges
incorrect amounts billed, or delayed payments being processed

05 Enquiries related to Policy Renewal and payment

Reduced clarity on renewal terms and conditions
Understanding of the reason behind the increase in premium
Issues with the online payment
